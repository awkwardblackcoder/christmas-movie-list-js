# christmas-movie-list-js

Spreading a little holiday cheer "tech style" with this simple Christmas Movie List, built entirely with HTML, CSS & Vanilla JavaScript.

## Concepts covered in this project

* **Arrays**: script stores names of movies in an array
* **For loops**: script loops through array to add movie name to each label element in document
* **ForEach**: script loops through each check box to verify if it is checked and calculates number of checkboxes checked. Then it displays that number on the webpage.
